## Introduction

This is a quick tutorial on how to calculate $A^B$ in $O(\log B)$ time complexity.

## Prerequisites
* Binary numbers

## Recursive algorithm
The recursive algorithm is easy to understand. Let $F(A,B) = A^B$. Then we have:
$$
F(A,B) = 
\begin{cases}
1 , & \text{if } B = 0 \\
F(A, \frac{B}{2})^2 , & \text{if } B \text{ even} \\
A \cdot F(A, B-1) , & \text{if } B \text{ odd}
\end{cases}
$$

It's easy to see that in every two steps, the exponent decreases by half, as shown by the following example:

## Iterative algorithm
Recursive algorithms are always a bit slower than iterative ones, so we'd want to figure out how to do this iteratively, which isn't instantly obvious.

Let's say we want to calculate $a^{13}$. Notice that $13 = 1101_2 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 \Rightarrow a^{13} = a^{2^0} \cdot a^{2^2} \cdot a^{2^3}$. Notice that $a^{2^1}$ is missing because the $1^{th}$ bit of $13$ is disabled.

So, we need to calculate all values of $a^{\text{power of two}}$, then discard the powers of two where the corresponding bit is zero. Luckily, that is simply repeated squaring:
$$
\begin{cases}
a = a^{2^0} \\
a^2 = a^{2^1} \\
\left( a^2 \right)^2 = a^{2^2} \\
\left( \left( a^2 \right)^2 \right)^2 = a^{2^3}
\end{cases}
$$

The short implementation is as follows:
```cpp
long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (b > 0) {
        if (b & 1) res = res * a;
        a = a * a;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Introduction

Sqrt decomposition has to be one of the simplest and most versatile trick in competitive programming. I'd love to apply it any time I can :> I adore its simplicity.

This tutorial will present a Sqrt decomposition solution to the the problem [CSES - Substring Reversals](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2073).

## Prerequisites
* Just the meaning of square root, but it's actually fine if you don't know it.

## Part 1: Storing ranges
Now I first present an unoptimized solution that still TLEs in the worst case. Then I'll improve this solution to give it time complexity of $O((N + M)\sqrt{N})$.

Firstly, let's say the string $S = S_1 S_2 S_3 \dots S_n$, where $n = |S|$, and each of $S_i \; (i \in [1, n])$ is a character. If we reverse the substring from $3$ to $6$, the string becomes $S_1 S_2 S_6 S_5 S_4 S_3 S_7 S_8 \dots S_n$. In other words, that is $S[1,2] + R(S[3,6]) + S[7,n]$, where $S[i,j]$ denotes the string $S_i S_{i+1} S_{i+2} \dots S_{j-1} S_{j}$, and $R(S[i,j])$ denotes the string $S_{j} S_{j-1} \dots S_{i+2} S_{i+1} S_i$.

So, the string goes from $S[1,n]$ to $S[1,2] + R(S[3,6]) + S[7,n]$. We can store this change by storing number pairs. Imagine we initially have a list of pairs $L = [(1, n)]$. After the above update, $L$ becomes $[(1, 2), (3,6), (7, n)]$. Since the range $(3,6)$ is reversed, let's flip the numbers and give it negative signs: $L = [(1,2), (-6,-3), (7, n)]$ (this actually makes the implementation very clean).

When we need to reverse the substring from $i$ to $j$, we split the ranges in $L$ to make them disjoint, and reverse the ranges between $i$ and $j$.

Now we have an algorithm that do updates by modifying the list. Here's a gif that demonstrates the algorithm for queries of reversing substrings $[3,6]$ and $[1,4]$:
